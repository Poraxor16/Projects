//Connections:
1) IR Sensors:
Sensor 1 (Entry): Connect the VCC pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino, GND to ground, and the signal pin to digital Pin 2.
Sensor 2 (Exit): Connect the VCC pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino, GND to ground, and the signal pin to digital Pin 3.

2) Servo Motor:
VCC (red wire): Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
GND (black wire): Connect to GND on the Arduino.
Signal (yellow or white wire): Connect the signal wire to Pin 9 on the Arduino.

3)Red LED:
Anode (longer leg): Connect directly to Pin 4 of the Arduino.
Cathode (shorter leg): Connect directly to the GND of the Arduino.
